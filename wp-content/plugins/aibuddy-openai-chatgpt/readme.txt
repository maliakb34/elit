* Topic field: This is the area where you can input your desired topic or keyword for the content you want to generate. The plugin offers two options - **Generate All** and **Try Sample**. The Generate All button will generate all content sections via a single prompt, while the Try Sample button will generate a preview of the first section.
* Title: After entering the topic or keyword, you can provide a title. This will be displayed at the top of the generated content page and will give readers an idea of what it’s about.
* Sections: You can choose the number of sections you want to include in your content. Users can add or remove sections as needed and can also choose to include introduction and conclusion sections.
* Content: Within each section, the plugin generates a well-written paragraph that is relevant to the topic or keyword entered. You are free to edit and customize each paragraph to your liking or choose to regenerate content for a specific section.

## GENERATE AMAZING IMAGES BY AI IN MINUTES

The image generator module tool, based on ChatGPT AI, helps you to create images by entering prompts through a command line. This can be useful for automating the creation of large numbers of images, as well as for creating images with specific parameters. The module leverages **DALL-E model** by OpenAI.

One important aspect of this module is controlling the number of images being generated. Simply describe the image you need and specify the number of images you need.

With AiBud WP you don’t need to have design skills! You can create unique logos, graphics, photo-realistic scenery, banners, product descriptions, cartoon portraits, and digital art. The only limit is your imagination.

## PLAYGROUND MODULE

The Playground is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the AI and explore its capabilities via  a live dialogue. You can ask any question and get a response immediately. 

The module utilizes OpenAI's advanced **Davinci model**, which uses deep learning algorithms to generate high-quality text that is both relevant and engaging. The model is trained on very large datasets ensuring that generated responses are accurate and unique.

One of the key features of the Playground module is that users can control the **Temperature** and **Max Tokens** of the generated text. Temperature controls the creativity of the AI's responses, with higher temperatures leading to more creative and unpredictable outputs. Max tokens, on the other hand, limit the length of the generated text, ensuring that responses are concise and to-the-point.

## AiBUD WP PRO: CHATBOT
Pro version of plugin includes a **Chatbot** is a powerful tool that allows users to perform various tasks based on requests and instructions. With customizable appearance and advanced features, it can be easily integrated into any website. Chatbot is available exclusively in the [Pro version of the plugin](https://stylemixthemes.com/aibud-wp/?utm_source=wporg&utm_medium=ai-buddy&utm_campaign=landing-page).
